## Description
This application runs a series of command-line prompts in order to generate a professional looking README.md file for a project. It utilises the Inquirer Node.js module to prompt the user to fill out each section of the README, also selecting a license that their work will be covered under. Once generated, the README will display all answers to the prompts in the appropriate section, and also feature a badge image for the chosen license at the top of the page.
